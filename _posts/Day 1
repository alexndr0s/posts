Thinking about where I should start, it became clear—I had to begin with the basics. 
So, I joined the Cisco Networking Academy. It felt like a solid first step. 
Virtual networks, protocols, simulated labs—great stuff. 
It actually reminded me of my university days, messing around with it.

But of course, reality stepped in. 
  
Cisco Packet Tracer wouldn’t install properly on Linux. 
I spent about half an hour searching for solutions, trying things, 
poking around forums. Nothing worked. 
The classic “just download the Windows .exe and run it through WINE” 
kept popping up. 
But I didn’t want to. Unless it's a last resort type thing.

So I moved on. Gave IBM SkillsBuild – Cybersecurity Fundamentals a try. 
It looked slick, but once I got into it, it felt more like it was designed for high schoolers. 
Too much fluff, not enough technical substance. 
I needed something else.

So, I circled back. I’d used Packet Tracer before. 
I didn’t want to abandon it just because of a setup issue. 
So after resisting for a solid 45 minutes, I caved and installed WINE.
Worked.
Just lost all morning doing nothing.
At least I got to play with the terminal a bit, learned a couple new things.

Not good, but not bad.
