As you can understand, I haven't done this before.
But, a bit about me:
I am Greek, currently working as a line cook and attempting to get back to what I went to university for:
Software and Networks!

I really liked the subject since I learn about as a kid, however due to unexpected twists of fate I had to focus on just getting by.

I have a general idea on most concepts, however I am starting re-learning everything I think I know.

It will be hard on me as the summer season is fast approaching and I 'll have to work under extreme conditions without rest-days for 5 months, but I 'll try to keep at it.

Feel free to send a message if you want to offer help, critique or just chat! I hope to know more about the community also!
